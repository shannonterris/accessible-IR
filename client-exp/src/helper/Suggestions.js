  // take input of the current tiles selected and current search term

  // if search term and tiles are nothing

  // If search term and one tile
  // This is a/an "search term".
  // Multiple tiles
  // Which "search term" do you like? These are different "search term"

  // for text info
  //TODO: research what bing api can give back
  // but maybe give defintion of search term
  // title of where image tiles are from
  // exert from image tile websites

  // Suggestions could show up as bubbles under each input
  // For longer suggestions like the text info, might want to make it a hover or when
  // you click the button it enters more text and button just says "defintion"
  return <div></div>;
